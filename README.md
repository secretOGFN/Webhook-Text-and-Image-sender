ðŸ“„ README
This is a simple Discord Webhook sender I made using AHK. It has two versions:

One that sends an embed with a title, description, and image

Another that sends text-only embeds with color selection and optional description

ðŸ”§ How It Works
It uses PowerShell in the background to send the embed data to your Discord webhook. You fill out the info, hit the button, and it sends it directly to your channel.

âœ… Features
Title + optional description support

Color dropdown (for text version)

Image preview (for image version)

Simple and clean UI

Works with any valid Discord webhook

Everything is local â€“ nothing gets uploaded or stored

ðŸ–± How to Use
Run the script

Enter your Discord webhook URL

Fill in a title (required)

Optionally add a description

(For text) Choose a color

(For image) Paste an image link

Click Send
